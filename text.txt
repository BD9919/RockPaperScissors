I want to return true for a playerSelection win
and a true for a computerSelection win.

if they tie i do not want to return "its a tie".

UPDATING UI Walk through;

When i click a button choice i want to have the cpu randomly generate a choice. and determine
who the winner is.

i want the scoreboard to keep track of each round, so when the user wins i want to add one to the
player scoreboard, and when the cpu wins. i want to add one to the cpu scoreboard.

when the score for either player makes it to 5 i want the let the user know if they won or lost.

after the game is won i must disable the buttons so that they are no longer clickable.

i should bring up a prompt/alert that will give the user a chance to restart the RPS game.

i want to be able to restart the game after the final score has been reached.
